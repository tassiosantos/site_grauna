A simple, clean admin theme with select features to extend and improve your WordPress experience.

== Description ==

The Zeus WordPress Admin plugin is a pragmatic solution to improve upon the slow changing WordPress dashboard.  The idea is
to bundle multiple features that bring the WordPress admin to a more modern level.

The plugin extends WordPress by installing the following features:

*   **Improved admin CSS** - Simple and minimal CSS markup to improve read-ability and overall backend experience.  Slightly wider
admin menu and modifications to colors and spacing go a long way.  Instead of creating an "admin theme" where WordPress becomes
un-recognizable, I simply took the same approach WordPress had, and improved upon it.
*   **Hide Front-End Toolbar** - Implemented the ability to move the front-end toolbar off the page.  This is especially
important for site that use fixed position navigation menus.  Simply click and arrow on the toolbar and watch is slide away.  Adds
and arrow to your toolbar, when clicked the toolbar will slide away and body will be restored to original position.
*   **Global Admin Search** - Search through your entire WordPress back-end and view real-time results.  Makes jumping to a certain
post/page/product/custom post type extremely easy.  Click the icon in the top bar or type '/' to start a search.
*   **Menu Editor** - Nothing is more annoying than a cluttered menu because every plugin is fighting for space.  Use
the menu editor to move top-level menu items anywhere you want.  Simply click, drag, and drop directly in the admin menu.
